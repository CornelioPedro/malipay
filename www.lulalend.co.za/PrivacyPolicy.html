                                    <li>Lula Lend shall not act unreasonably when processing Your personal information. This means that it will collect and process Your personal information in a way that You can reasonably expect and in a way that is fair.</li>
                                    <li>Lula Lend shall respect Your right to privacy at all times. If there is another way in which it can achieve the same goal without posing any risk of harm to Your privacy rights, then it will choose that option.</li>
                                    <li>Similarly, if Lula Lend needs to process personal information but there are less privacy-invasive methods of collecting, using and sharing that information, then it will use those methods.</li>
                                    <li>Lula Lend shall ensure that the personal information that is collected and processed is and remains relevant to the identified purpose/s for such processing, and that such information is and remains adequate, but not excessive, for achieving the identified purpose/s.</li>
                                    <li>If there are any alternative ways to achieve the identified purpose/s without processing personal information, Lula Lend shall not process that personal information.</li>
                                    <li>Lula Lend shall ensure that the processing activities it chooses to apply are proportionate to achieving the identified purpose/s and that no less privacy invasive measures are available to achieve the same purpose/s.</li>
                                    <li>Lula Lend shall ensure that, regardless of the stated purpose/s for processing personal information, the rights and interests of users such as You will not be unnecessarily prejudiced or infringed, unless it cannot be avoided, and then in such cases, it shall ensure that its own rights and/or interests justify such prejudice or infringement taking place.</li>
                                    <li>Once Lula Lend has achieved the purpose for the collection of Your personal information, it will destroy or delete such information, unless You have directed otherwise in writing, or Lula Lend is required by law to retain the information for a longer period of time.</li>
